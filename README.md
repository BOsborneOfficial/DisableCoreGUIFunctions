# DisableCoreGUIFunctions
A plugin designed to make disabling default TopBar icons and some settings in the Roblox menu easier. This project was not originally open-source but I've decided to work on a much powerful replacement for it. I also didn't want to leave this project in the dark with no updates, instead the community will now be helping to update the plugin.
