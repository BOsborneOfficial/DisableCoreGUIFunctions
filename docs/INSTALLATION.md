# DisableCoreGUIFunctions Installation

First, download the code in main and then find the DisableCoreGUIFunctions.rbxm file. Once you've found it, place it in %AppData%\Roblox\Plugins. After that, the plugin is now installed locally. 

To edit the file, find your DisableCoreGUIFunctions.rbxm file and make sure Studio is open (ideally on a baseplate) and then drag the RBXM into the Workspace folder. You should now be able to edit the plugin.
